                   Excellence is derived from the inifinitive to excel, which is excrescence. When therefore, of two objectts which are similar, one has an extra characteristic, that object is described as excelling the other, no matter what is excellence may be. Thus saying that the horse is more excellent than the donkey means that the horse shares with the donkey the capacity for carrying burdens, but excels it in charging, wheeling, swiftness, and beauty. However, should a donkey possess a ganglionary growth it would not be describedas more excellent, because the ganglion, though an excrescence on the body, is in the reality a defect, an imperfection. in adddition the aminal is sought for its useful qualities, not for its physical features.

               </p>

                   If you then understand this, it will be clear to you that knowledge excels when compared with the other attributes, jus as the horse is distinguished when compared with other animals.
                   Futher more, while swiftness is an excellent[feature] int the horse, in itself it has no excellence. knowledge,however is in itselfan absolute excellence, apart from any attribution. It is the destricption of God's perfection, and through it[11] the angles and the prophets were imbued with honor. The fleet horse is better the the slow. knowledge is, therefore, an excellence in the absolute and apart from any attributes.
